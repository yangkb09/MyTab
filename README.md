# MyTab

A progressive web app (PWA) allowing users to split bills and track shared expenses.

MyTab is a PWA that saves friendships - I mean - makes bill splitting easier. Users can download the PWA onto their phone like a native app, or access the web app via a browser. Users can add friends, create groups, and track expenses within each group.
